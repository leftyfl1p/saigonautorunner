# saigonautorunner

This was an experiment to see if I could find a way to automate running saigon since it took around 200 tries to succeed. The original process of: booting the phone, wait a minute to significantly increase chances of success, running the app and waiting 20 seconds, then repeat the process all over again was extremely tedious. With these tools I was able to plug my phone in, sleep, wake up and it was done.
